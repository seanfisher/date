Dear <%= @invitation.recipient_name%>:

<%= @sender_name %> has invited you to try <%=t :site_title %>, a new website where you can share your fun date ideas and get ideas in return. <%=@sender_name%> said:

<%=simple_format(h(@invitation.personal_message))%>

Signup here: <%= @signup_url %>

About <%=t :site_title %>:
Ever asked somebody on a date, put down the phone, and then turned to your buddy and said, "oh man!  Now we've got to think of something to do!"
<%=t :site_title %> is a database full of fun date ideas.  You can narrow your ideas down by price range, age range, location, and more!
When you've come up with a great idea, share it with the world!  Let others try it out, rate it, give it feedback, and love it.
We're currently in beta, so feel free to leave us feedback.  Wouldn't it be cool if you suggested changing the color of a link and came back the next day and it was changed?
